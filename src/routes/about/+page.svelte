<p class="my-4 text-lg text-gray-500">The CuratorBot (CB) is a prototype conversational agent system developed by H. Gu and J.S. Love at TU Delft under the aegis of the Future Libraries Lab. It is an experimental research tool in the form of a system intended to be used to interrogate the ways in which people could interact with rapidly developing natural language technology within cultural heritage settings. The CB has been conceived of as a supplement to docents (tour guides) or curators for people exploring library and museum collections. It is further meant to give some grounding to the extensive debates surrounding applied machine learning technologies, their opportunities and their limitations. </p>
